First game written on C-language

This game is written out of boredom and does not claim to be praised.

How to use:
Press 1 to start the game. 
Use WASD to move numbers in the appropriate direction.
When two numbers that have the same value are next to each other and move one after the other,
then they merge, and the result of the addition is added to your score.
